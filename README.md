This Python project implements a Rock Paper Scissors game using computer vision techniques. It utilizes the `cvzone` module for hand detection to recognize hand symbols and updates the score accordingly.

## Features:
- Hand detection using `cvzone` for precise gesture recognition.
- Real-time gameplay against the computer.
- Score tracking for both the player and computer.
- Simple and intuitive user interface.

## Requirements:
- Python >= 3.10
- OpenCV
- cvzone

## Usage:
Only windows systems will support automatic installation of necessary modules.
Please refer to requirements.txt for requirements for different OS.
